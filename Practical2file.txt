#Practical 2 (due next practical): 
Exercise in Building Tools to Analyze Sequence Data Quality

Data files: seq_reads
Contains three short read .fasta data files with sequences of various quality
Challenge #1: DS1, DS2 are synthetic DNA data sets 
Build two tools (R or python3) to visualize and analyze data quality:
1. Plot DNA length v. Q, length v. number of N ambiguities, Q v. N
2. generate a heatmap comparing the two data sets
Challenge #2: SRR14149060 is from a breast cancer study
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR14149060 
1. Analyze read lengths: are these human reads? To what do they target?2. Generate concept for a rapid mapping of reads to the human genome to assess quality and distribution
